# 🆔 Aadhaar Atlas
## Visualising India’s Identity Enrolment Landscape
## UIDAI National Hackathon Submission
## 📌 Overview
**Aadhaar Atlas** is an interactive analytics and decision-support platform that transforms aggregated Aadhaar enrolment data into actionable societal and administrative insights.
The project is designed to help UIDAI identify enrolment trends, regional disparities, age-wise patterns, and district-level anomalies to support data-driven planning and governance.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Aadhaar enrolment datasets capture large-scale demographic and regional information but are primarily used for static reporting.
There is a need to unlock deeper analytical insights that can support:
- Proactive operational planning
- Identification of regional stress points
- Improved accessibility and inclusion
- Evidence-based decision-making

## 💡 Solution

Aadhaar Atlas applies structured data analysis and visualisation techniques to convert enrolment data into an interactive intelligence framework, enabling UIDAI stakeholders to:
- Monitor enrolment trends over time
- Analyse age-group-wise enrolment behaviour
- Detect district-level anomalies and volatility
- Explore insights through a modern dashboard

## 📂 Datasets Used
UIDAI-provided aggregated and anonymised Aadhaar Enrolment Datasets, containing:
**Date of enrolment**
**State, district, and PIN code**
**Age-wise enrolment counts:**
- 0–5 years
- 5–17 years
- 18+ years
🔐 No personally identifiable information (PII) is used.

## 🧠 Methodology
Merged multiple UIDAI enrolment CSV files
Standardised date formats and validated records
**Performed feature engineering:**
- Total enrolments
- Child vs adult enrolments
- District-level volatility metrics

## 📊 Key Insights
Enrolment demand varies significantly across time and regions
Strong concentration of enrolments in child and adolescent age groups
Certain districts exhibit unusually high enrolment volatility, indicating potential migration, special drives, or administrative stress
